## Overview 
Through APIs, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I created a weather dashboard where consumers can search and view current and 5-day forcasts of their desired city. 

## User Story
```md
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```md
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

## How This Was Achieved
<ul>
<li>Using type to search, the user can search for their desired city to view weather.</li>
<li>The current weather pops up with location, temperture, UV index, humidity, and high speed</li>
<li>The full 5-day forcast pops up as well showing the above features for the next 5 days.</li>
<li>A responsive layout and styling features to make the application unique to me.</li>
</ul>
